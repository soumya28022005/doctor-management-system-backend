// PHASE 04 MOCK DATA — public doctor/clinic discovery.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: Public list/detail endpoints (`GET /api/v1/doctors`,
// `GET /api/v1/clinic`, `GET /api/v1/clinic/:id`, `GET /api/v1/reviews`)
// are NOT exposed by the backend (all routes are auth-protected; see
// docs/BACKEND_FRONTEND_CONTRACT.md §2.2/§2.7/§2.9 "TO BE CONFIRMED").
// Phase 04 builds the public UX against this isolated module.
//
// PHASE 09 STATUS: BLOCKED — re-verified against src/. The only doctor/clinic
// discovery endpoints are `GET /api/v1/doctors/search?name=` and
// `GET /api/v1/doctors/clinics/search?name=`, and BOTH require authMiddleware
// (no anonymous access) and are name-search only — there is no unauthenticated
// list or public profile endpoint. These public pages are unauthenticated, so
// they cannot call them. A public discovery contract is TO BE CONFIRMED WITH
// BACKEND TEAM; this module stays as the data source (no fake wiring).
//
// SHAPES mirror the Prisma `Doctor` / `Clinic` models from the contract so a
// real public API can replace this module with no UI changes.
//
// ⚠️ MOCK CONTENT — not verified medical/provider data. Do not ship any
//    hardcoded entry as if it were a real practitioner.
