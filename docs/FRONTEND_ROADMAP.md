## Phase Details

### Phase 0: Repository Reconnaissance & Documentation
- **Status**: `COMPLETED BY THIS TASK`
- **Objective**: Perform exhaustive static analysis of the backend codebase (`src/`), database schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`), WebSocket infrastructure (`src/sockets/`), environment configuration (`.env.example`), and design reference ([Zoom Doctor](https://www.zoomdoctor.in/)).
- **Scope**:
  - Map all 16 Express API modules and route prefixes.
  - Map all 16 Prisma models, 11 enums, and relationships.
  - Map all Socket.io rooms (`queue:<doctorId>:<clinicId>`, `appointment:<id>`, `clinic:<id>`) and events (`queueUpdate`, `tokenCalled`, `appointmentCompleted`, `appointmentNotification`, `announcement`).
  - Create the 6 core architectural documentation files inside `docs/`.
- **Deliverables**:
  - `docs/FRONTEND_ROADMAP.md`
  - `docs/UI_INVENTORY.md`
  - `docs/USER_FLOWS.md`
  - `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
  - `docs/FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `docs/BACKEND_FRONTEND_CONTRACT.md`
- **Definition of Done**: All 6 documentation files written cleanly to `docs/` with zero modifications to backend files (`src/`, `prisma/`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, root `package.json`, `turbo.json`).

---

### Phase 1: Frontend Monorepo Foundation
- **Status**: `COMPLETED (Phase 01 task)`
- **Objective**: Establish a stable, un-overengineered monorepo foundation using JavaScript (`.js` / `.jsx`), Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS, and Turbo.
- **As-built notes (Phase 01)**:
  - A pre-existing TypeScript frontend (route-group pages in both apps, TS package stubs) existed from commit `6c5820a` and was **preserved non-destructively**; the JS/JSX foundation was added alongside it. New foundation code is `.js`/`.jsx` only.
  - JS package entry points: `packages/{ui,utils,types,api-client,config}/index.js` (ESM packages carry `"type": "module"`; `@doctor/config` is CommonJS because it hosts Tailwind/ESLint configs loaded via `require`).
  - Smoke-test pages: `apps/patient-web/app/foundation/page.jsx` and `apps/staff-dashboard/app/foundation/page.jsx` consume `@doctor/ui`, `@doctor/utils`, `@doctor/types` (Zod), and `@doctor/api-client`.
  - Pre-existing defects fixed minimally: invalid `@tailwindcss base;` directives corrected to `@tailwind base;` in both `globals.css`; staff-dashboard route groups `(doctor)/(receptionist)/(admin)/(clinic)/(super-admin)/(auth)` resolved duplicate-path collisions by converting to literal segments (`/doctor/dashboard`, etc.); `turbo` added as root devDependency and `turbo.json` migrated `pipeline` → `tasks` (Turbo 2); `packageManager` field added to root `package.json`.
- **Scope**:
  - Verify workspace references in root `package.json` (`apps/*`, `packages/*`).
  - Configure `apps/patient-web` (port 3000) and `apps/staff-dashboard` (port 3001) as JS-first Next.js App Router projects.
  - Preserve any existing TS scaffold files without destructive mass-deletion; ensure clean JS resolution.
  - Configure Tailwind CSS using the version already installed in the workspace (do NOT force arbitrary upgrades/downgrades).
  - Scaffold minimal entry points in shared packages: `@doctor/ui`, `@doctor/api-client`, `@doctor/types`, `@doctor/config`, `@doctor/utils`.
- **Dependencies**: Phase 0 completion.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Working `apps/patient-web` landing page (`app/page.js`).
  - Working `apps/staff-dashboard` landing page (`app/page.js`).
  - Minimal package export index files (`index.js`).
- **Backend Dependencies**: None (frontend foundation only).
- **Definition of Done**: `npm run build:frontend` or `turbo run dev` executes without errors. Both web apps render baseline home pages.

---

### Phase 2: Design System Implementation
- **Status**: `COMPLETED (Phase 02 task)`
- **As-built notes (Phase 02)**:
  - Design tokens (status palette, elevation, Inter font stack) live in the shared preset `packages/config/tailwind/tailwind.config.js` (Tailwind v3.4.19, unchanged).
  - 18 primitives in `packages/ui/components/`, all re-exported from `packages/ui/index.js`. Existing TSX pages untouched; no JS/TS duplication created.
  - Visual verification page at `apps/patient-web/app/design-system/page.jsx` and `apps/staff-dashboard/app/design-system/page.jsx` exercises every primitive + state; staff-dashboard gained a minimal root `app/page.jsx` portal picker (previously 404).
- **Objective**: Implement reusable, accessible, medical-themed UI components in `@doctor/ui` inspired by Zoom Doctor design language.
- **Scope**:
  - Color system: Medical Emerald (`#0D9488`), Navy Blue (`#0F172A`), Soft Slate (`#F8FAFC`).
  - Primitive UI components (`.jsx`):
    - `Button` (Primary, Secondary, Outline, Ghost, Danger, Loading)
    - `Input` / `Select` / `Textarea` / `Checkbox` (With label, error helper text, left/right icon slots)
    - `Card` (Header, Body, Footer, Hoverable)
    - `Badge` (Status variants: Waiting, Checked-in, Completed, Cancelled, Absent, Emergency)
    - `Avatar` (Patient/Doctor profile pictures with fallback initials)
    - `Modal` / `Dialog` (Overlay, title, close action)
    - `Table` (Header, Rows, Loading state, Empty state)
    - `Tabs` (Tab bar, active indicator)
    - `Spinner` / `Skeleton` (Loading placeholders)
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1 foundation.
- **Deliverables**:
  - `@doctor/ui` export index containing all atomic components.
  - Zero business-logic pages inside `@doctor/ui`.
- **Definition of Done**: Every UI primitive is exported cleanly and can be consumed by both `patient-web` and `staff-dashboard`.

  - Modular API Services: `authService`, `doctorService`, `patientService`, `appointmentService`, `queueService`, `clinicService`, `notificationService`.
  - Zod Form Validation: Attach Zod schemas (`@doctor/types` or local app validations) to patient registration, walk-in form, appointment booking, and doctor schedule settings.
  - Error Handling UI: Display field-level Zod validation errors and toast alerts for API error responses.
- **Dependencies**: Phase 8 authentication.
- **Backend Dependencies**: All Express routes (`/api/v1/*`).
- **Definition of Done**: All application views perform real API requests with clean input validation and error handling.

---

### Phase 10: Realtime + QA + Production Polish
- **Status**: `FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION`
- **Objective**: Connect Socket.io client for live queue/token updates, notifications, and conduct end-to-end QA.
- **Scope**:

## Architectural Risks & Mitigation Strategies

1. **Risk: Breaking Backend Code During Frontend Setup**
   - *Mitigation*: Strictly enforce the protection rule. Files in `src/`, `prisma/`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `Dockerfile` MUST NOT be modified under any circumstances by frontend tasks.
2. **Risk: Token Drift / Session Expiration During Live Queue Usage**
   - *Mitigation*: Implement silent token refreshing in `@doctor/api-client` via background refresh calls prior to access token expiration.
3. **Risk: Socket Reconnection Overhead in High-Traffic Clinics**
   - *Mitigation*: Ensure client socket leaves rooms (`leaveQueue`, `leaveAppointment`) on component unmount to prevent memory leaks and orphan socket subscriptions.
